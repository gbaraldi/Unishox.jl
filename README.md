**Unishox.j;** is a Julia package that provides access to the compression and decompression functions in the [**Unishox**](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox2) C library.
It's algorithms are optimized for short Unicode strings. Compression is performed using an hybrid encoder that uses entropy, dictionary and delta encoding. For more details check the [**article**](https://github.com/siara-cc/Unishox2/blob/master/Unishox_Article_2.pdf?raw=true)

Two functions are exported by this package: `compress` and `decompress`.
Both accept a single `AbstractString` argument and return a `String`.
It's important to note that the output from `compress` may not be valid UTF-8, which the `String` type doesn't care about, but your use case might.

Here's an example using the functions at the REPL.

```julia
julia> using Unishox

julia> s = "ðŸ˜†I can do emojis"
"ðŸ˜†I can do emojis"

julia> sizeof(s)
19

julia> compressed = compress(s)
"\x9f\xc0R\xe3\x05\xaeg\x17T\x9f\x9a\xfd\xbd\x17"

julia> sizeof(compressed)
14

julia> decompress(compressed)
"ðŸ˜†I can do emojis"
```

This package is based on the [**Shoco.jl**](https://github.com/ararslan/Shoco.jl) package.
